Differential cortical activation according to the leading-phase polarity
of intracortical microstimulation

 The present script, inlcuding all accompanying sub-scripts, was used to
 analyze the data and prepare the figures for the manuscript entitled
 "Cathodic-leading pulses are more effective than anodic-leading pulses in
 intracortical microstimulation of the auditory cortex" 
 by Mathias B. Voigt and Andrej Kral.
